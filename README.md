In this game, you control a jet trying to avoid enemy missiles using arrow keys. The enemies intelligently pursue your jet using A* pathfinding, making it challenging to evade them. Dodge the missiles for as long as possible to survive!

**Implementation:**
This project implements the A* algorithm in Python to create an engaging game where enemies track the player's position intelligently.

## How A* Works

A* (A-star) is a pathfinding algorithm that efficiently finds the shortest path between two points. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Initialization:**
   - A* starts with a start node and a target node.
   - It creates an open set containing the start node.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - A* evaluates nodes based on the cost to reach them and an estimate of the cost to reach the target (heuristic).
   - It selects the node with the lowest total cost from the open set.
   - The selected node is removed from the open set and added to the closed set.
   - A* expands nodes adjacent to the selected node and adds them to the open set if they haven't been visited before.
   - The process continues until the target node is reached or there are no more nodes to explore.

3. **Path Reconstruction:**
   - Once the target node is reached, A* reconstructs the path from the start node to the target node.
